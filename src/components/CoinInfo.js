        Cryptocurrency Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by
        cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or
        double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on
        blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate
        network of computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not
        issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to
        government interference or manipulation.
